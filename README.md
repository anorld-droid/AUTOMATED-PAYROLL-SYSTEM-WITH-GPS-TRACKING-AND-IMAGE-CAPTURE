# AUTOMATED-PAYROLL-SYSTEM-WITH-GPS-TRACKING-AND-IMAGE-CAPTURE.
This Automated payroll system doubles up as a web and android application, while the user will use the android interface, the admin, usually the HR, will use the web interface. The system works as follows. Each employee is given an employee ID and password for accessing the app from their devices. When an employee logs into the system from an android device, the user image is captured immediately. The system then sends the user image and their GPS location to the admin. As long as the user stays logged into the system via the android device, the GPS location will continue to be automatically updated and forwarded to the admin every five minutes. When the user logs out, their image and GPS location are sent to the admin. This application allows admins to keep track of employee attendance and payroll. The admin creates employee profiles for each employee by entering all relevant personal information (name, job-position, qualification, etc.). They can also check salary details and break-down of the salary of each employee by entering the employee ID and date. Since the application is GPS enabled, no employee can add proxy attendance. This enables the HRs to keep an accurate record of working days of individual employees and tweak their payroll accordingly. Employees can use the android application to check their leave status, view salary details, yearly holiday lists and also for voicing grievances and resigning.
